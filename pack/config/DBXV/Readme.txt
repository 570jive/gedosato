This is my profile for Dragonball Xenoverse

I was unable to find the HUD Pixel SHader Injector.  But my changes to the Gedosato ini and post.fx do not effect the HUD in any
negative way.

This is a work in progress. But I find that I enjoy playing the game more with these settings.  Try them out for yourself.

Backup your old settings if you have them.

The biggest change is the colors are more vibrant.  And I used the post.fx bloom.  I also used Gedosato AA.  There's also a
transparency to things now  (Not exactly "lore" friendly as cartoons don't have transparency).  
SSAO and DoF are not supported so I have them turned off in Gedosato.  There is an in-game DoF.  I have that turned off too.
I like it better that way.


I think these settings make the game look more realistic.  Whether that is a good or bad thing is up to you.  I like them.
